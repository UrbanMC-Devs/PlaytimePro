This plugin tries to incorporate more features while still being more efficient than the original playtime plugin.

What are the new additions?
Weekly and Monthly playtime!

How/why is this plugin more efficient?
We made this plugin more efficient by doing some things:
- Not using a task to keep track of playtime
- Not storing all the playtime in memory
- Moving the IO off-thread

So how did we accomplish those things?
Let's walk through an overview of what happens when a player logs on to the server.
Silverwolfg11 logs on to the server. The plugin checks if there is already an OnlineTime object
allocated to silver. If there is, then we do not create a new one, and simply just update the login time for silver.
If there is not an object allocated, then we create a new object (which marks the login time), add it to the
concurrent hashmap of onlinetimes, and also request to get the playtime of silver from the database.

A few minutes later, the plugin then loops through all the cached players, and updates the database with their playtimes,
and resets their login times to the current times. The plugin then loops through all the online players and removes the caches
of those who are not online anymore.

When a player logoff, their login time is set to -1, but their tempstoredtime variable is updated.
